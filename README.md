# SQL-Data-Warehouse
Building an SQL Data Warehouse Solution from scratch

## üìå Overview

This project is my hands-on exploration of **data engineering** concepts, focusing on data extraction, transformation, loading (ETL), and pipeline automation. 
It serves as a learning project to gain practical experience with real-world datasets while developing a structured approach to data warehousing.

## üéØ What I'm Learning

- **Data Extraction**: Retrieving data from APIs, databases, or flat files.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleaning, structuring, and preparing data for storage.
- **ETL Pipeline**: Automating data ingestion and processing steps.
- **Data Warehousing**: Implementing a structured database for efficient querying.
- **Automation & Scheduling**: Utilizing **Apache Airflow** or similar tools for workflow automation.
- **Data Visualization**: Presenting insights using **BI tools** like Power BI or Tableau.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies I'm Using

- **Python**: For scripting and data processing.
- **SQL**: For querying and managing structured data.
- **Apache Airflow**: For orchestrating data workflows.
- **Docker**: For creating containerized environments.
- **Cloud Services** (optional): AWS, GCP, or Azure for scalable storage and compute solutions.
- **BigQuery / Snowflake** (optional): Exploring cloud-based data warehousing solutions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
   cd your-repo-folder
   ```
2. **Set up the environment**:
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure database connections
   - Set up ETL pipeline with Airflow
   
3. **Run the project**:
   - Start containers if using Docker
   - Execute the ETL pipeline
   - Query the warehouse for insights

This repository will evolve as I progress, integrating new concepts and refining my approach to data engineering.
